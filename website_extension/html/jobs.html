                        I built a city within ButtlerBot that has various jobs available. All the jobs 
                        pay the same amount to the same level ranked employees to keep things fair. Being 
                        able to advance through the levels to be able to prestige is based off the amount
                        of time you spend playing the casino games, being active in chat channels, buying
                        and selling stock, earning paychecks from working, and various other methods of being 
                        able to earn <a href="../html/currency_info.html">in-game currency</a> to spend at
                        the shops. At this time, the shops are only available via the
                        <a href="../main.html">KasMek Programming Team Home Page</a>. From there you'll click 
                        on Mekasu's hyper-link, followed by clicking ButtlerBot, and finally clicking Casino 
                        Games. You'll be prompted to enter your guild id and member id which will connect 
                        your login to ButtlerBots database to ensure that you get your winnings!

                        The jobs within ButtlerBots' City Extension can all be found below. The breakdown 
                        of pay per level of job is as follows:<br>Owner = $5,000<br>Financial Officer = $3,000<br>
                        Labor Officer = $3,000<br>Quota Officer = $3,000<br>Supervisor = $1,500<br><br>After each
                        upper management has been paid, the left over sum is then divided by the number of hired 
                        hands. To give an example, if the job pays $45,000 you'll subtract $15,500 to pay all 
                        of upper management leaving $29,450. This sum is then divided by the number of hired hands. 
                        Let's say we hired 6 people to help with this job so $29,450 divided by 6 equals $4,908.33
                        per hired hand. In addition, each employee has a flat rate of 3% taken out for taxes, and
                        and additional 1% taken out for their 401K. In other words, $4,908.33 minus 3% taxes equals 
                        $4,761.08 then subtract the 1% 401k equals $4,808.69 deposited into each employees bank account.
                        This applies to all job positions excluding Doctors, Nurses, Education, and Newsletter Staff.
                        These job positions will pay a flat salary of $1,500 per week. On each pay day, 3% is taken out 
                        for taxes, and 1% is taken out for your 401K. You can apply the same math above to equate your 
                        net pay on each pay day. Pay days are every Friday at 3pm. If you do not receive your pay 
                        check, please go to our <a href="https://discord.gg/weREZMjr3s">ButtlerBot Support</a> discord
                        server. From there, reach out to a staff member and we will help you from there.
