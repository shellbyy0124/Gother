            Determining how to portray the lawyer jobs correctly
            has been a rather difficult journey for me as I do not 
            have much expertise in this area of life, however, after 
            some brainstorming, I have made a cliff notes version. Please
            send me your thoughts on where I can more accurately portray
            the following jobs. Thanks -Mekasu

        <h2 id="h2">Managing Partners -- Requires Prestige Level 50+</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            Managing Partners are paid $15,000 per case closed.
            As a managing partner you are responsible for the firm as a whole.
            This includes but is not limited:<br>
            --Present at each case for each lawyer assigned to you.<br>
            --Ensuring correct legal proceedures are being followed.<br>
            --Reviewing financial, laboral, and quotation reports from company officers.<br>
            --Action Agreements are made as whole not as one person.<br>
            **At any time that a decision is to be made from weekly reports and all managing
            partners are not present, a recess is to be called until all managing partners can 
            be present**
        </p>

        <h2 id="h3"><u>Financial Officer -- Requires Prestige Level 30+</u></h2>
        <p id="p3">
            The Financial Offer tracks down information from the various cases 
            closed throughout the week and sends them to the managing partners
            inbox. Much like the other jobs within ButtlerBot City, the jobs 
            are based on a scavenger hunt style-based game. Financial Officers
            are paid $5,000 per case closed.
        </p>
    </body>
    <body id="body4">
        <h2 id="h4"><u>Labor Officer -- Requires Prestige Level 30+</u></h2>
        <p id="p4">
            The Labor Officers' job is much like the Financial Officers job 
            as it's a a chase through the channels as well. Labor Officers are 
            also paid $5,000 per case closed.
        </p>
    </body>
    <body id="body5">
        <h2 id="h5"><u>Quota Officer -- Requires Prestige Level 30+</u></h2>
        <p id="p5">
            The Quota Officer produces reports as well that are based off 
            the number of jobs performed within the week that is compared 
            to "last years" numbers to see if the company is losing out 
            on or gaining customers. Quota Officers are also paid $5,000
            per case closed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="h6"><u>Lawyers -- Requires Prestige Level 20+</u></h2>
        <p id="p6">
            Lawyers are practically the grunts of the business. They're paid 
            based off how long it takes to complete each case they are assigned
            to. The algorithm for this job has not been created yet thus rendering
            these jobs unavailable for the time being.

        <h2 id="h7"><u>Para-Legals -- No Level Requirement</u></h2>
        <p id="p7">
            Para-legals are paid 1.5% of the Lawyers pay per para-legal 
            hired to assist in each case. The more para-legals hired, the less
            the lawyer gets paid so be smart in your team!

        <h2 id="h8"><u>Benefits</u></h2>
        <p id="p8">
            <u><b>401K</b></u>
            401K is a percentage decided by the Managing Partners and is taken out of everyones pay.
