        <h1 id="h1"><u>Being The Mayor Of The City</u></h1>
        <p id="p1">
            First and foremost the mayor of the city is the owner of the 
            discord server. There is no way that I would be able to setup 
            an entire election process that would allow members to elect who 
            the mayor of the city would be and it allow the actual guild owner 
            to remain in charge as the discord server in its entirety is virtually 
            converted into a city by inviting ButtlerBot to the server. With that
            being said, the Mayors job is to review reports that are generated from 
            the owner of each company and sent in so that the mayor can see whether 
            the pay rates set for each job is sufficient enough to be maintained by 
            the initial starting guild balance ($1,000,000,000). The Mayor also retains 
            the ability to remove any company owner from power given that corruption has 
            taken over and the employees have gone on strike. In order for employees to go 
            on strike, more than 60% of the companies employees must use the !strike command 
            and place themselves on strike. When the employees go on strike, they lose all 
            pay and benefits. In the event that the company is forced to close and a new owner 
            takes over, the 401K that has been paid in for each employee per pay day is therein 
            left at the same amount, each employees pay increases by $100 and their prestige level 
            increases by 1.

        <h2 id="h2"><u>Upon Inviting ButtlerBot To Your Server!</u></h2>
        <p id="p2">
            When you invite Buttlerbot to your server, please be aware that the bot is going to ask 
            you a series of questions. I know this sounds like a pain in the butt, but it's so that 
            each mayor can setup their city in the mannor that they choose. As a person myself, I do 
            not have the liberty of telling any guild owner what they can or cannot do with their server
            but I am able to provide extra options that my bot will automatically handle for them.<br><br>
            When ButtlerBot joins your server, it will send the guild owner a direct message. The first
            question that it is going to ask is whether the guild owner wants to participate in the city 
            extension or not. In the event that the guild owner says no, the bot will not create anything 
            pertaining to the city, and in order to get the city extension to become available, the guild 
            owner will need to remove and re-invite the bot as there is no setup currently to change a guild 
            from a non-participant to a participant.
