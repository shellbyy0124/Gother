        <p id="p1">
            Law Enforcement are the ones who are typically your moderators
            and various levels of staff that are within your discord server.
            The Chart is as follows:<br>
            -Chief Of Police = Administrator<br>
            -Detectives = Moderators<br>
            -Police = Community Helpers<br>
            -Meter Maids = Trial Staff Member<br>
            Your Meter Maids are those who are being brought on, or hired, as 
            staff and are in a 90 day probationary period. After 90 days, they 
            will become regular Police and will advance from there.

        <h2 id="h4"><u>Detectives</u></h2>
        <p id="p4">
            Detectives are responsible for investigating issues that arise within the discord. If 
            there is an instance of let's say bullying to come about within one of the discord channels, 
            then it is up to the detectives to pull each member into the interrogation room and find out 
            what happened. Once all the facts have been discovered, the guilty and innocent party, and 
            their record has been pulled, a report is then filled out and sent to the Chief of Police to 
            further investigate and determine a course of action. If the case needs to go to court, then 
            the Chief of Police will let the clerks know and a court date will be scheduled. If the member 
            cannot be present for the court date and time, then a replacement date and time may be made within 
            reason. They primary concern is the "Publics Safety". Detectives are paid $1,750 per case closed 
            that they are assigned to.

        <h2 id="h5"><u>Police</u></h2>
        <p id="p5">
            Police officers are the ones who get called when a person would dial 911. They're the ones who
            arrive on scene, get pictures, statements, etc that will be needed and will determine whether 
            and investigation will be needed or not. After all required information has been obtained, the 
            police officers will then write a report that will be sent either to the database and logged as 
            a detective was not needed for the case, or will be sent to the detectives inbox for further
            investigation. Police officers are paid a flat $1,300 per case closed that they are assigned to.

        <h2 id="h7"><u>Clerks</u></h2>
        <p id="p7">
            Clerks are the ones who set date and times for court dates. They're also in charge of ensuring 
            that fines are paid, warrants are issued, etc. The clerks fill out reports based on each court 
            date that is being scheduled/rescheduled. Included in the reports are the number of times the 
            current case number's court date and time has been rescheduled. At any given point, the clerk 
            is allowed to no longer reschedule court dates.
