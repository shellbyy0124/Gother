            Being able to create jobs that incorporate the food industry has 
            also been a challenge effort to say the least. I honestly have not 
            been able to find a way to incorporate the jobs that represent food 
            and make it a scavenger hunt style-based game. Please use the suggestion 
            command within your discord command to give me some suggestions on ways 
            you think would make for great food jobs! -Mekasu :D
