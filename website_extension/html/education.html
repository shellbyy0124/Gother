            To make an entire education system would take more time than 
            what it would be worth. Instead, I have setup buttlerbot to 
            ask the Mayor of the city if they would like to have the bot 
            create a role within the discord server for those who like to 
            share informative information with others. In addition to this, 
            if the discord server owner says yes to allowing this role, it
            will also create a new category with text channels to allow for 
            a space where those with the "Education" role can post their 
            informative information. Those who obtain this role will be paid 
            a salary of $10/post made. Do not rely on this as a main income as 
            you may only post up to <i>n</i> informative facts per week that the 
            mayor chooses.
