                        ButtlerBot will soon be the bot for all bots. What I mean is, Buttlerbot will be able to do nearly everything
                        for you from moderating your guild. From ensuring that your cities have enough money and resources to survive
                        to filtering out unwanted words within the communities chat channels. Buttlerbot is being built for much much
                        more, though. In the years to come, we plan to setup ButtlerBot Discord Vs 3.0 to where one discord server
                        (guild henceforth) will be able to have multiple cities to allow for dictatorships, and other types of lifestyles
                        that each city may want. Also incorporated into ButtlerBot is a suggestion command. I highly encourage you to use
                        this command as it will send your suggestions straight to my database for me to be able to view. I have a taskloop
                        setup that pulls the first 20 suggestions per week in the database for me to view. Upon approval, the extension
                        will be created and once ready for action, a notice will be put out in the newsletter by Buttlerbot that shows all
                        types of awesome information! So don't forget to subscribe to the newsletter !subnews so that every Monday you get
                        the newsletter right in your DM's!
