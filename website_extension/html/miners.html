            Miners within ButtlerBot City are those who dig the resources needed
            to print money for the city. Each city has to have miners as there is 
            no way to send money between cities. This is to prevent nations from 
            becoming too large in quantity and prevents capital wars. Your city
            must survive on its' own! mwahaha may the odds be ever in your favor!!!

        <h2 id="h3"><u>Pay</u></h2>
        <p id="p3">
            Miners are paid per dig they are hired for. The digs are setup in a bidding mannor in 
            which your supervisor must be on top of their game at the bidding wars each week. For
            Example: If your supervisor wins a bid that pays $45,000 and he hires 15 guys to work
            the job, then we just follow the math:<br>
            owner = receives $5,000 flat<br>
            finance officer = receives $2,000 flat<br>
            quotas officer = receives $2,000 flat<br>
            labor office = receives $2,000 flat<br>
            supervisor = receives $1,500 flat<br>
            this gives us our remaining balance then the hired hands are paid by taking
            the remaining balance and dividing it by the number of hired hands leaving the
            gross pay per hired hand. Take that remaining balance and divide by the number
            of hired hands.<br>From there, the owner has decided the percentage that is taken
            from your gross pay and that is then deducted from your gross giving you your net
            so yo put this into a math equation. . .<br><br>
            $45,000 (pay from job)<br>
            -$5,000 (owners cut)<br>
            -$2,000 (finance officers cut)<br>
            -$2,000 (labor officers cut)<br>
            -$2,000 (quota officers cut)<br>
            ------------<br>
            $34,000 (balance 1)<br>
            -$1,500 (supervisors cut)<br>
            ------------<br>
            $32,500 (remaining balance)<br>
            (multiply by number of hired hands)<br>
            ------------<br>
            (gross pay per hired hand)<br>
            (multiply by 401k percentage set by owner)<br>
            ------------<br>
            (net pay direct deposited into each hired hands bank account)

        <p id="p4">
            <u><b>Company Owner -- Requires Prestige Level 50+</b></u>
            Receives reports from the companies financial, labor, and quota
            supervisors. These reports are generated based off the performance 
            of the company versus the payouts to each employee on pay days. The 
            owner of the company can then decide whether to change the percentage
            of 401K taken from the employees to increase it, but they cannot
            decrease it. This is to create a more challenging work environment and 
            to prevent owners from becoming corrupt and keeping the left over money
            for themselves. The owner receives 3%

            Generates financial reports which shows all money incoming 
            and all money outgoing for various areas of the company and

            down timers which are fake loading timers that would "virtually"
            mimik real life report generation.

        <p id="p6">
            Generates labor reports which shows all hired hand hours 
            that have been spent versus their pay rates and determines 
            whether each hired hand, supervisor, and officer are being

        <h2 id="h7"><u>Supervisor -- Requires Prestige Level 20+</u></h2>
        <p id="p7">
            Bids weekly on various paying jobs. The Supervisor is not 
            bidding against other cities but rather is bidding against 
            an algorithm that randomly decides which bids are available
            and gives clues as to where the supervisor can find the bids 
            hidden within the discord channel, and what they needs to do in 
            order to find out whether they can win the bid or fail. Think of 
            it as one massive scavenger hunt style-based game. There will be random 
            instructions places in various parts of the discord server and you 
            have to find them, and follow them in order to get the next clue.

        <h2 id="h8"><u>Hired Hand -- No Level Requirement</u></h2>
        <p id="p8">
            Are hired to assist with various bids. Only one Hired Hand can work
            One Bid at a time. This is to prevent confusion, and taking advantage 
            of the system. The more hands that are hired to participate within the 
            hunt, the less the pay so be smart about your crew supervisors!
