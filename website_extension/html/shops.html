            Shops that have items available for real cash purhcases
            will be marked with a dollar sign ($). If you do not see
            the dollar sign ($), then you will need to have in-game 
            currency. If you do not have in-game currency, then we 
            recommend you to submit ButtlerBot to your guild owner 
            for review to be admitted to your guild, and your guild 
            owner must opt in for the City Extension so that you have 
            casino games, and jobs, available to you to earn in-game 
            currency.<br>-Mekasu

                        This shop is ran and maintained by me, Mekasu, as it showcases items that
                        are crocheted, knitted, graphghaned, tunisian simple-stitched, or otherwise 
                        hand crafted that we have for sale. I am willing to ship the items given that 
                        the buyer is able to show legal verification that they are who they say they 
                        are. <u><b>ALL ITEMS WILL NEED TO BE PAID FOR FIRST BEFORE ITEM IS RECEIVED!</b></u>

                        The GBot Catalog is a shop for all merchandise that promotes ButtlerBot. These items 
                        can be paid for by <a href="../html/currency_info.html">in-game currency</a> or with
                        real cash. This catalog is under construction, and once the shop becomes fully open,
                        a message will be sent out with the weekly newsletter. If you are not subscribed to
                        receive the weekly newsletter, then please use the !help command within your discord
