        <p id="p1">
            At this current time there are no casino jobs available as the 
            casino is ran completely by Buttlerbot himself. A break down of
            how the casino games will work is that 0.5% of each members winnings 
            are paid to the discord servers (guilds) bank, and jackpot, to help 
            keep the flow of cash alive for the entire city. Think of it as taxes.
            If the city runs out of money, then members will need to donate in order
            to keep the city alive. If the city's bank remains at a $0 balance for longer
            than 60 <b>REAL LIFE DAYS</b>, then the city will be rendered to inactive 
            and all jobs will be shutdown as there is no money left to pay everyone with.
