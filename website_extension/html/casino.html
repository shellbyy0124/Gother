            Gother is designed to automate the city life in the sense of ensuring paydays 
            are covered, casino stays on track, and everyones banking system stays up to
            date. In the coming times, I do plan to incorporate a notification system 
            that users can subscribe to via a command to which once a week they will receive
            a <a href="../html/weekly_update.html">weekly update</a> on everything they did 
            the last week. I am torn between making it one long embed that is sent, or if I 
            should do it in a paginator embed style to where you can click through the pages 
            and see it as an online newspaper. If you would like to share your thoughts, you 
            may do so <a href="https://github.com/shellbyy0124/Issues">here</a> on my Github 
            Repository named Issues. I do plan, as well, to shift from having my respository 
            linked liked I did here, and have it as a command to where users can send their 
            suggestions, and they'll be created as ticket numbers and written to a database 
            and backed up to the Issues respository.

<!--Left off with placing more links to relavent information within the above paragraph
then building a bot command (or testing existing things within Gother) for users to 
post their issues to my database, and to the respository-->
