                <h1><u><b>About Gother:</b></u></h1>
                <p>
                    Gother came about from the original idea of ButtlerBot.
                    The only difference is the name change.<br> ButtlerBot come 
                    about one day while I was hanging out with a dear friend 
                    of mine who was working on some code back around fall of 
                    2020. I had been interested in coding before, and had tried 
                    to many fails, although I was determined I was going to 
                    not fail this time, so I set off on an adventure.<br> My friend 
                    told me that the hardest part of being a programmer is being 
                    able to create something no one else has. <u>That was my mission!</u>
                    I wanted to create something no one else had, so after much debate
                    with my friend, I had decided I wanted to build a discord bot,
                    however, the issue is there is just about every type of
                    <a href="https://www.top.gg/">discord bot</a> already created.<br>
                    so what was I going to create that others hadn't? Well after 
                    almost a year of writing code, trashing it, writing more,
                    scribbling in notebooks and ripping the pages out in frustration
                    I just figured I would make a bot that does practically everything!
