                    Millerboy is the owner and operator of Shuffles Art, LLC. They have been a close friend
                    of mine for quite some time. With learning how to develope software, websites, and discord 
                    bots my friend asked if I would be up for the challenge of building him a software that meets 
                    his needs as an artist that would allow him to showcase his art work, accept freelancing work, 
                    and have a social gathering place for other artist and art enthusiast. To view any artists art
                    work that they have available you can click their icon below to go to their home page where their 
                    catalog is featured.
