            Hi There! Below you will find information regarding Gother and how
            he acts throughout his files, what they do, and why.

                            When Gother first joins your discord server, the first thing he does is get 
                            you squared away within his database. From recording your member count to setting 
                            your members up with an empty, but brand new bank account. A way to build a profile 
                            to display to their friends that shows accomplishments and such. Jobs that will be 
                            setup that also pay the employees every Friday given that the guild owner opts in for 
                            the city extension. [See <a href="../html/jobs.html">Jobs</a>]<br><br> You can find

                            When Gother is no longer a member of you server, your information is 
                            theoretically frozen. What I mean is that since Gother is a self-hosted 
                            bot, the database, and such will be stored locally on whatever hosting service 
                            you're using, or on your home pc. In the event that you bring Gother back 
                            into your server, your information will be updated in the on guild join function.
                            <br><br>TL:DR There is no function for on_guild_leave as Gother is self-hosted. Files
                            exist whever you host Gother.<br><br>You can find the

                            When a member joins the guild, Gother is setup with a function that checks if
                            the member already exists within the database. If they don't, then it writes them
                            to the database with fresh, but empty, information such as their guild id, member id,
                            zero warnings, zero mutes (which are tallied when a staff member executes the warn/mute
                            command), a $0 bank balance, and other items.<br><br>You can find the

                            When a member leaves the discord, instead of going through and trying to save all of their
                            data, Gother will remove them completely. In the event that a user needs to be dismissed 
                            from the guild, but you do not want to completely erase their saved data so that they can 
                            return at a later date, then please use the !mute command with the time in seconds of how 
                            long they need to be dismissed from the guild. You can find a seconds converter 
                            <a href="https://www.convertworld.com/en/time/seconds.html">here</a>.<br><br>There is no
