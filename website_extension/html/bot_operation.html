            Hi There! Below you will find information regarding Buttlerbot and how
            he acts throughout his files, what they do, and why.

                            When ButtlerBot first joins your discord server, the first thing he does is get 
                            you squared away within his database. From recording your member count to setting 
                            your members up with an empty, but brand new bank account. A way to build a profile 
                            to display to their friends that shows accomplishments and such. Jobs that will be 
                            setup that also pay the employees every Friday given that the guild owner opts in for 
                            the city extension. [See <a href="../html/jobs.html">Jobs</a>]

                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When ButtlerBot is no longer a member of you server, your information is 
                            theoretically frozen. What I mean is that since ButtlerBot is a self-hosted 
                            bot, the database, and such will be stored locally on whatever hosting service 
                            you're using, or on your home pc. In the event that you bring ButtlerBot back 
                            into your server, your information will be updated in the on guild join function.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>On Member Join

                        <li>
                            When a member joins the guild, ButtlerBot is setup with a function that checks if
                            the member already exists within the database. If they don't, then it writes them
                            to the database with fresh, but empty, information such as their guild id, member id,
                            zero warnings, zero mutes (which are tallied when a staff member executes the warn/mute
                            command), a $0 bank balance, and other items.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>On Member Leave
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When a member leaves the discord, instead of going through and trying to save all of their
                            data, ButtlerBot will remove them completely. In the event that a user needs to be dismissed 
                            from the guild, but you do not want to completely erase their saved data so that they can 
                            return at a later date, then please use the !mute command with the time in seconds of how 
                            long they need to be dismissed from the guild. An example would be:<br>
                            60 seconds = 1 minute<br>
                            120 seconds = 2 minutes<br>
                            180 seconds = 3 minutes<br>
                            240 seconds = 4 minutes<br>
                            300 seconds = 5 minutes<br>
                            600 seconds = 10 minutes<br>
                            900 seconds = 15 minutes<br>
                            1200 seconds = 20 minutes<br>
                            1500 seconds = 25 minutes<br>
                            1800 seconds = 30 minutes<br>
                            3600 seconds = 60 minutes<br>
                            7200 seconds = 2 hours<br>
                            14,400 seconds = 4 hours<br>
                            259200 seconds = 3 days<br>
                            604800 seconds = 1 week<br>
                            2592000 seconds = 1 month 
                        </li>
